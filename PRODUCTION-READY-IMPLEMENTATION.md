## 🔧 Production Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: production-database-setup.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Whop Configuration
WHOP_GROWTH_PLAN_ID=plan_your_growth_plan_id
WHOP_PRO_PLAN_ID=plan_your_pro_plan_id
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Resend
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

### 3. Whop Dashboard Setup
1. Go to your Whop App Dashboard
2. Create pricing plans:
   - **Growth Plan**: $49/month (5,000 emails)
   - **Pro Plan**: $99/month (10,000 emails)
3. Set up webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook`
4. Configure webhook events: `membership.created`, `membership.cancelled`, `payment.succeeded`

### 4. Test the Implementation
1. **Free User Flow**:
   - Send 10 emails → should work
   - Try to send 11th email → upgrade modal appears
   - Check dashboard header → shows "FREE" badge with usage

2. **Paid User Flow**:
   - Upgrade to Growth/Pro plan
   - Dashboard header shows plan badge
   - No daily limits, only monthly tracking
   - Settings page shows monthly usage only

## 🛡️ Security & Abuse Prevention

### Implemented Safeguards
1. **Database-Level Protection**
   - Row-level security (RLS) policies
   - SQL functions for safe email counting
   - Audit logs for all email usage
   - Plan change history tracking

2. **API-Level Protection**
   - Webhook signature verification
   - User authentication checks
   - Rate limiting between emails (600ms delay)
   - IP and user agent logging

3. **Plan Enforcement**
   - Server-side limit validation
   - Automatic plan downgrades on cancellation
   - Fresh billing cycle resets
   - Abuse detection through usage patterns

## 📊 How It Works

### Free Plan (10 emails/day)
```
User sends email → Check daily count → If < 10, allow → Update counter
If ≥ 10 → Show upgrade modal → Block sending
```

### Paid Plans (Monthly limits)
```
User sends email → Check monthly count → If < limit, allow → Update counter
If ≥ limit → Show "wait for next billing cycle" message → Block sending
```

### Plan Management
```
Webhook received → Verify signature → Update user plan → Reset counters
Payment successful → Reset monthly count (new billing cycle)
Cancellation → Downgrade to free plan → Switch to daily limits
```
