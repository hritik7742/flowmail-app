# FlowMail Daily Email Limits Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented daily email limits for FlowMail Whop app with free plan restrictions and upgrade modal functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Daily Email Limits
- **Free Plan**: 10 emails per day (24-hour period)
- **Growth Plan ($49/month)**: 167 emails per day (~5,000/month)
- **Pro Plan ($99/month)**: 334 emails per day (~10,000/month) - **UPDATED from 25,000**

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Added `emails_sent_today` column to track daily usage
- Added `last_email_reset_date` column to handle daily resets
- Created database functions for automatic daily count resets
- Created function to get daily limits based on user plan

### 3. API Endpoints Updated
- `/api/send-campaign-simple/route.js` - Added daily limit checks
- `/api/send-campaign/route.js` - Added daily limit checks  
- `/api/check-email-limits/route.js` - New endpoint for checking/updating limits

### 4. Upgrade Modal
- Beautiful, modern modal that appears when daily limits are exceeded
- Shows current usage statistics
- Displays both Growth ($49) and Pro ($99) plan options
- Integrated with Whop payment system
- Pro plan correctly shows 10,000 emails/month (updated from 25,000)

### 5. Pricing Updates
- Updated all pricing references to show Pro plan with 10k emails instead of 25k
- Updated setup-plans API to reflect correct Pro plan limits
- Updated settings page to show correct limits

## Files Modified

### Database
- `add-daily-email-limits.sql` - New database schema for daily limits

### API Routes
- `app/api/send-campaign-simple/route.js` - Daily limit checks + tracking
- `app/api/send-campaign/route.js` - Daily limit checks + tracking
- `app/api/check-email-limits/route.js` - New limit checking endpoint
- `app/api/setup-plans/route.js` - Updated Pro plan description

### Frontend
- `app/experiences/[experienceId]/FlowMailApp.tsx` - Added upgrade modal + limit handling
- `app/settings/page.js` - Updated plan pricing display

## How It Works

1. **Daily Reset**: Email counts reset automatically at midnight based on `last_email_reset_date`

2. **Limit Checking**: Before sending emails, system checks:
   - If it's a new day (resets count if needed)
   - Current daily usage vs. plan limits
   - Shows upgrade modal if limits exceeded

3. **Upgrade Flow**: When limits exceeded:
   - Modal shows current usage statistics
   - User can choose Growth ($49) or Pro ($99) plans
   - Integrates with Whop payment system
   - Automatically refreshes limits after successful upgrade

4. **Email Tracking**: After successful sends:
   - Updates both daily and monthly counters
   - Maintains date tracking for proper resets

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Free users get 10 emails per day
2. When limit is reached, upgrade modal appears automatically
3. Can upgrade to Growth ($49) or Pro ($99) plans for higher limits
4. Limits reset daily at midnight

### For Developers
1. Run `add-daily-email-limits.sql` in Supabase to add required database columns
2. All email sending routes now automatically check daily limits
3. Upgrade modal appears automatically when limits are exceeded
4. No additional configuration needed - works out of the box

## Testing
- Test with free plan by sending 10+ emails
- Verify upgrade modal appears with correct statistics
- Test upgrade flow with Whop payment system
- Verify daily reset functionality

## Notes
- Pro plan updated from 25,000 to 10,000 emails per month as requested
- Daily limits calculated as monthly_limit รท 30 days
- Graceful handling of edge cases (timezone, leap years, etc.)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing monthly limits
