# EMAIL FORWARDING SOLUTION

## Problem
When users send emails from their professional address (e.g., `hritik.abc123de@flowmail.rovelin.com`), replies are not being delivered to their actual email address.

## Solution
Set up email forwarding using Resend's webhook system to forward replies to the user's reply-to email.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Resend Webhook Setup
- Configure webhook in Resend dashboard
- Handle incoming email events
- Forward emails to user's reply-to address

### 2. Database Schema
Already implemented:
- `reply_to_email` field in users table
- Professional email generation system

### 3. Email Headers Configuration
When sending emails, ensure proper headers:
```
From: Display Name <username.uniquecode@flowmail.rovelin.com>
Reply-To: user-actual-email@gmail.com
```

### 4. Webhook Handler
Create API endpoint to handle incoming email webhooks from Resend and forward them to the correct user.

## Current Status
✅ Database schema ready
✅ Professional email generation working
✅ Custom domain support (without unique codes)
⚠️ Need to implement webhook handler for reply forwarding

## Next Steps
1. Set up Resend webhook endpoint
2. Create email forwarding logic
3. Test reply functionality
4. Update email sending to include proper Reply-To headers
