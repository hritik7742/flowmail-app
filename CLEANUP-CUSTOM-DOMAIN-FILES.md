# Custom Domain Cleanup

Since we've removed custom domain functionality to reduce costs, here are the files you can optionally delete to clean up your codebase:

## API Routes (Optional to Delete)
- `app/api/register-custom-domain/route.js` - No longer needed
- `app/api/verify-domain/route.js` - No longer needed  
- `app/api/setup-domain-columns/route.js` - No longer needed

## SQL Files (Keep for Reference)
- `add-resend-domain-columns.sql` - Keep in case you want to add custom domains later
- `DOMAIN-MANAGEMENT-SCHEMA.sql` - Keep for reference
- `DOMAIN-SETUP-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md` - Keep for when you're ready to implement

## Test Files (Optional to Delete)
- `test-domain-setup.js` - No longer needed

## What We Kept
- Database columns are still there (no harm in keeping them)
- Domain settings API still works (just returns null for custom domain fields)
- All the core email functionality remains intact

## Benefits of This Change
✅ Reduced infrastructure costs
✅ Simpler codebase to maintain  
✅ Clear messaging to users about future plans
✅ Easy to re-enable when ready to upgrade

The app now focuses on the core email marketing features while setting clear expectations about custom domains coming in the future!
